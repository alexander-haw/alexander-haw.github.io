Alexander Haw: My Mission
I have an extremely motivated personality and I'm always going out of my way to go above and beyond in my work. Engineering is seriously my passion in life and I can't see myself doing anything else. I have two years of experience as an engineering intern at a manufacturing plant. I have great attention to detail and I will tirelessly work until the job is done and done right.
